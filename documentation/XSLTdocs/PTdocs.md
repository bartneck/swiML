Documentation for steps in swiMLPT.xsl 

Transforming xml documents defined by swiML.xsd and swiMLFlat.xsl into plaintext documents
This document outlines how each section of the resulting plaintext document is constructed with reference to individual functions and templates in swiMLPT.xsl

Process works the same as in swiML.xsl but much simpler as there are no other types of instructions and all other elements are ignored.
