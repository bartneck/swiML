# swiML
A project to formalise swimming programs using XML

The goal of this project is to develop a communication standard for swim training programs that can be used to exchange training programs between webservices, apps, and fitness trackers. In addition, it features a transformation of turing valid XML files into beautifuly formatted instructions that can be printed or displayed on devices.
