# swiML

![logo swiML](https://bartneck.github.io/swiML/swiMLLogoGradient.png)

A project to formalise swimming training programs using XML. Our repository is available [here](https://github.com/bartneck/swiML).

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a communication standard for swim training programs that can be used to exchange training programs between web services, apps, and fitness trackers. While there are some standards available for logging your exercises, none focus on what you want to swim.

Each trainer has his/her own taxonomy and nomenclatures for the various exercises. The Swimming Markup Lanuguage (swiML) will provide a standard for naming. The goal is also to allow for customisations to accommodate local preferences. In addition, it features a transformation of turning valid XML files into beautifully formatted instructions that can be printed or displayed on devices.

Here is a short video that introduces swiML:

# Book
My book Swim Training Patterns that describes the use of swiML in detail is now available for pre-order from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3QHJEvy) and [Routledge](https://www.routledge.com/SWIM-TRAINING-PATTERNS-Plan-your-Training-Sessions-with-the-Power-of-Mathematics/Bartneck/p/book/9781032880075).

# Architecture
swiML consists of an XML based swim training program that can be validated against the swiML Schema (XSD File). A swiML XML file can be generated directly in XML or using the Python library. If the file is valid, then it can be transformed using XSLT to HTML (XSL File).

# Usage
Here is an example of a very simple training program:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<program xmlns="https://github.com/bartneck/swiML"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://github.com/bartneck/swiML https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartneck/swiML/main/version/latest/swiML.xsd">
    <poolLength>25</poolLength>
    <lengthUnit>meters</lengthUnit>
    <instruction>
        <length>
            <lengthAsDistance>100</lengthAsDistance>
        </length>
        <stroke>
            <standardStroke>freestyle</standardStroke>
        </stroke>
    </instruction>
</program>
```

Or if you want to model a repetition you can write:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<program xmlns="https://github.com/bartneck/swiML"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://github.com/bartneck/swiML https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartneck/swiML/main/swiML.xsd">

            <repetitionCount>4</repetitionCount>
            <instruction>
                <length><lengthAsDistance>100</lengthAsDistance></length>
                <stroke><standardStroke>freestyle</standardStroke></stroke>
            </instruction>
        </repetition>
    </instruction>
</program>
```

## Documentation
- A tutorial chapter in my book Swim Training Patterns: [Swimming Markup Language](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-mono/10.1201/9781003535829-3/swimming-markup-language-christoph-bartneck?)
- A [HTML-based documentation](https://bartneck.github.io/swiML/documentation/XSDdocs/swiML.html) for the XML Schema is available as well as a [PDF version](documentation/XSDdocs/swiML.pdf). 
- A [HTML-based documentation](https://bartneck.github.io/swiML/documentation/XSLTdocs/swiML.html) for the XSLT Tranformation is available. We also have a [ReadMe documentation](https://github.com/bartneck/swiML/blob/main/documentation/XSLTdocs/XSLTdocs.md). 
- [Python examples](https://github.com/bartneck/swiML/tree/main/documentation/pythonExamples) are avaiable.
- My [swiML YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNoiyEjV43RzxH_o4E_7v0Q9yWhG7taKX) contains videos that showcase the use.

## Tools
We recommend an XML authoring tool, such as [Oxygen Author](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_author.html) to write, validate and transform swiML documents. Alternatively, there are XML plugins for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml) and [Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-xml-editors-and-tools). JetBrain's [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) has the complete XML/XSLT workflow build in and is free for non-commercial use.

## Files
You can use the swiML Schema (swiML.xsd) to validate your swiML file. You can then use the XSLT (swiML.xsl) to tranformation the swiML XML to HTML.

To reference the swiML Schema you can point directly to:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartneck/swiML/main/version/latest/swiML.xsd
```

## Versions
The version folder contains stable versions of the files while the root folder contains our work in progress. The latest stable version is available in:

```versions/latest```

## Python
We also developed a Python library that you can use to code your swimming program. It is available as a package over at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/swiml_python_xml/). You can find some example of how to use Python in our [Python Examples](https://github.com/bartneck/swiML/tree/main/documentation/pythonExamples) folder.

# Examples
A first test implementation showing the [training sessions](https://bartneck.github.io/swiML/jasiMasters/) for the [Jasi Masters](https://jasimasters.org.nz) swimming club in Christchurch, New Zealand is available. These programs demonstrate the usage of swiML, including examples of Python programs.
