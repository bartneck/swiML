continues and repitions recurring -> maybe switch symbols side                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
could use some text recognition library so people can take photos of sets and --> into swiML                 

continue of repetitions should be if 2x6x100 should say 12x100 swim as 6 of this 6 of that                         |
whereas normally it would be 1200 swim as 600 this 600 that                                                        | Complete
-> going to modify continue tag to include antoher tag specifying whether it denotes a continual block of swimming | 
such as 1200meters or to just simplify repitition expressions from 2x6x100                                         |

xslt now does multi level repetitions but doesnt work when there are more than one base instruction within the repetition

xsd assertion needed --> all instructions in a continue must be of type Distance or laps 
and they must all be the same type 

assertion for stroke inheritance -->
need to check for multiple continues or repetitions at the start as neither will have strokes defined 
-> maybe check for instructions with no other tag (rep or cont)

also need to repeat the stroke check for other possible points (rest, intenisty)
so that this can replace intensity across
