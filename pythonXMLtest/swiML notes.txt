continues and repitions recurring -> maybe switch symbols side                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
could use some text recognition library so people can take photos of sets and --> into swiML                 

continue of repetitions should be if 2x6x100 should say 12x100 swim as 6 of this 6 of that                         |
whereas normally it would be 1200 swim as 600 this 600 that                                                        | Complete
-> going to modify continue tag to include antoher tag specifying whether it denotes a continual block of swimming | 
such as 1200meters or to just simplify repitition expressions from 2x6x100                                         |


xsd assertion needed --> all instructions in a continue must be of type Distance or laps 
and they must all be the same type
